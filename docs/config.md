## config.json

The general configuration and params of the workflows is set in the config.json file. Runnerty will try to get the config.json file in the actual path.

With the `-c` param it is possible to indicate a different path.

```shell
runnerty -c /path/config.json
```

The `config.json` file contains the configuration for the different triggers, executors, notifiers and global values (params, paths, files, etc.) which are going to be used on the processes:

```json
{
  "triggers": [
    {
      "id": "schedule_default",
      "type": "@runnerty-trigger-schedule"
    },
    {
      "id": "filewatcher_default",
      "type": "@runnerty-trigger-file-watcher"
    }
  ],
  "executors": [
    {
      "id": "shell_default",
      "type": "@runnerty-executor-shell"
    }
  ],
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "id": "telegram_default",
      "type": "@runnerty/notifier-telegram",
      "token": "MyTokenId",
      "chat_id": "MyChatId"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Triggers

Triggers are plugins which cause the execution of a chain.

The most common case is the schedule trigger which allows us to execute a chain with a periodicity like CRON.

Another example is the file watcher trigger. This trigger let us to execute a chain based on the events defined over a directory or file.
Have a look at: [triggers](triggers.md).

## Servers

Servers allow us to abstract ourselves of the endpoints implementation in a trigger development. Runnerty will set the servers indicated in the config file. It will take care about the routing and will serve one property for the triggers (`on_request`). In this property it will receive the requests of the endpoint. Moreover it allows customization of the response, also the status code and the possibility to send an object.

Have a look at: [triggers](triggers.md).

## Executors

Executors are plugins which enclose functionalities. These plugins allow Runnerty to execute processes, data bases operations, use external services, etc. There is a list of the official available [here](../plugins/).

The `config.json` is used to define all the executors that are going to be used in the whole plan.

This is an example of the configuration of two executors (shell and mysql):

```json
{
  "executors": [
    {
      "id": "shell_default",
      "type": "@runnerty-executor-shell"
    },
    {
      "id": "mysql_default",
      "type": "@runnerty-executor-mysql",
      "user": "mysqlusr",
      "password": "mysqlpass",
      "database": "MYDB",
      "host": "myhost.com",
      "port": "3306"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notifiers

Notifiers are plugins which allows Runnerty to notificate events that happen in the chain and processes to different services and channels. This is a list of the official available [plugins](../plugins/).

The `config.json` file contains all the notifiers that are going to be used in the whole plan.

This is an example of the configuration of two notifiers (mail and telegram):

```json
{
  "notifiers": [
    {
      "id": "telegram_default",
      "type": "@runnerty/notifier-telegram",
      "token": "MyTokenId",
      "chat_id": "MyChatId"
    },
    {
      "id": "mail_default",
      "type": "@runnerty/notifier-mail",
      "disable": false,
      "from": "Runnerty Notifier <my@sender.com>",
      "transport": "smtp://my%mailsender.com:pass@smtp.host.com/?pool=true",
      "bcc": ["mycc@mail.com"],
      "templateDir": "/etc/runnerty/templates",
      "template": "alerts",
      "ejsRender": true
    }
  ]
}
```

## Global Values

It is possible to define values that can be used in the chains an process (paths, files, data, â€¦):

```json
{
  "executors": [{ "...": "..." }],
  "notifiers": [{ "...": "..." }],
  "global_values": [
    {
      "my_files": {
        "file_one": "/path/MYFILE_ONE.csv",
        "file_one": "/path/MYFILE_TWO.csv"
      },
      "my_values": {
        "value_one": "VALUE_ONE",
        "value_two": "VALUE_TWO"
      }
    }
  ]
}
```

These values can be used in the whole plan (chains and proccess) referencing them. Runnerty has also some default values. Have a look at: [Global values](../values/#global-values).

## Encrypted Passwords

Runnerty offers the possibility to encrypt passwords so it is not necessary to put passwords on the config.json file.

```
runnerty -p master_cryptor_password -e password_to_encrypt
```

Note that `master_cryptor_password` is the personal password needed to decrypt the passwords.

This will return the encrypted password. Now, in the config.json you can use the encrypted passwords with the property `crypted_password` (Runnerty will decrypt the encrypted password in memory and send it to the executors):

```json
{
  "executors": [
    {
      "id": "mysql_default",
      "type": "@runnerty/executor-mysql",
      "user": "mysqlusr",
      "crypted_password": "ABDEFE1234..",
      "database": "MYDB",
      "host": "myhost.com",
      "port": "3306"
    }
  ]
}
```
