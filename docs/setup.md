This tutorial is intended for new users who want detailed instructions on how to build a basic Runnerty project. ðŸš€ Let's start!

## Requirements

### Node.js

You should see a version larger than Node 12.

```bash
node -v
v12.19.0
```

> Runnerty v2 minimum supported Node.js version is Node 12, but more recent versions will work as well.

### Runnerty (optional)

For this setup it is not necessary to install runnerty (it has been included as a dependency to simplify the process) but it is recommended to install it when you want to advance a little more.

```bash npm2yarn title="Open Terminal and simply runs this command"
npm install -g runnerty
```


```bash title="You should see a version"
runnerty -v
Runnerty 2.*.*
```

[Here you have more information about the use of runnerty in the terminal](CLI.md)
