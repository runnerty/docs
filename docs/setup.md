This tutorial is intended for new users who want detailed instructions on how to build a basic Runnerty project. ðŸš€ Let's start!

## Requirements

### Node.js

You should see a version larger than Node 12.

```sh
node -v
v12.19.0
```

> Runnerty v2 minimum supported Node.js version is Node 12, but more recent versions will work as well.

### Runnerty (optional)

For this setup it is not necessary to install runnerty (it has been included as a dependency to simplify the process) but it is recommended to install it when you want to advance a little more.

1. Open Terminal and simply runs this command:

```sh
npm install -g runnerty
```

You should see a version.

```sh
runnerty -v
Runnerty 2.*.*
```
